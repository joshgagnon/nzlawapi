        <paragraph>
            <label> 1 </label>
            <text> These proceedings concern a dispute over liability for the balance of bank loans made by the plaintiff bank, Westpac, to Gardost Properties Ltd, after security properties were sold and the proceeds were applied in reduction of the loans. The defendants are the shareholders of Gardost, and who guaranteed the loans. </text>

            <text> Westpac has obtained judgment against the first and second defendants by default, and has served bankruptcy notices on them based on those judgments. Westpac has settled its claim against the third defendant. </text>

                    <text> The first and second defendants initially opposed Westpac’s application, and brought their own applications, on the grounds that the guarantees are invalid (primarily because Westpac did not ensure that they received independent legal advice) and because they disputed the quantum of the debt (contending that Westpac breached its duty as mortgagee by selling the security properties below market value, and to the sales person acting on the sale). In further grounds advanced explicitly just before the hearing, the second defendant disputed liability under the guarantee on the grounds that it was executed under the undue influence of the fourth defendant (their son) which Westpac knew or ought to have known, and that Westpac had breached a duty owed to her as guarantor by lending imprudently. Although these further grounds were advanced formally only on behalf of the second defendant, they appear to relate equally to the first defendant. </text>

                <entry>
                    <label> b </label>
                    <text> The fourth defendant initially opposed Westpac’s application on the grounds that Westpac was in breach of its duty as mortgagee by selling at less than market value, and to the sales person acting on the sale, that the proceeding was not served validly, and that Westpac acted in bad faith by discontinuing the claim against the third defendant without notice to him (preventing him from claiming indemnity or contribution). He also amended his grounds prior to the hearing to include a contention that the guarantees were invalid for failure to ensure the guarantors had independent legal advice, and because Westpac acted imprudently in granting the loans. </text>

        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
            <label> 5 </label>
            <text> For the reasons I will give in this judgment, I find that the first and second defendants have not made out a case for setting aside the judgment against them, nor (consequentially) for the setting aside of the bankruptcy notices. Westpac has established the grounds for an order for adjudication. I also find that the fourth defendant does not have an arguable defence to Westpac’s application for summary judgment. </text>
