These principles provide greater guidance for balancing the need to collect levies that meet the lifetime cost of claims in a particular year, and the need to maintain a reasonable level of solvency and levy stability. </text></para><para><text>Secondly, this Bill will improve the governance of the process for setting levies by requiring the Government to set a funding policy in line with the statutory principles, which will inform ACC’s public consultation on levy rates. This will replace current provisions that require ACC to set the funding policy and will thereby improve the continuity between levies consulted on by ACC and subsequently agreed by the Government.</text></para><para><text>Thirdly, setting a funding policy will also improve the transparency of the levy-setting process, and ensure that the public is better informed. ACC will be required to report on the long-term implications new levy rates will have for future levy paths, Account solvency, and other elements relating to ACC’s funding.</text></para><para><text>Although elements of the Government’s funding policy could be issued by ministerial direction under the Crown Entities Act 2004, there are limits to the level of specificity and scope that is possible. It may also create confusion relating to ACC’s obligations. The amendments in this Bill will require the funding policy statement to be in line with the new statutory principles and roles for the Government and ACC. The Bill also outlines how the new funding policy statement will fit into the process for consulting on, and setting, levies. </text></para><para><text>The second objective is to ensure that the payment of residual levies continues only so long as there are outstanding liabilities for residual levies to offset. </text></para><para><text>In 1999, ACC moved to a system of fully funding the lifetime costs of an injury claim. Prior to this, levies covered only the current costs of a claim. Residual levies are required to meet the ongoing costs of earlier injuries, but should only be collected until those costs are met.  Currently, legislation provides that ACC must continue to collect residual levies until 2019.</text></para><para><text>The Bill provides for residual levies to be discontinued by Order in Council, reflecting the fact that residual liabilities will continue to fluctuate and that a decision to discontinue residual levies therefore needs to be made closer to the time at which it is appropriate to discontinue them.</text></para></explnote.group><explnote.group><heading>Departmental disclosure statement</heading><para><text>The Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment is required to prepare a disclosure statement to assist with the scrutiny of this Bill.
